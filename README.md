# Advent of Code 2023

Here are my attempts at the [Advent of Code 2023 challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Most of this repository, especially how the noxfile is set up, is inspired by [Claudio Jolowicz's Hypermodern Python series](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).
